### ****Part I****

1. make a directory called ***first***
    `mkdir first`

2. change directory to the ***first*** folder
    `cd first`

3. create a file called ***person.txt***
    `touch person.txt`

4. change the name of ***person.txt*** to ***another.txt***
    `mv person.txt another.txt`

5. make a copy of the ***another.txt*** file and call it ***copy.txt***
    `cp another.txt copy.txt`

6. remove the ***copy.txt*** file
    `rm copy.txt`

7. make a copy of the ***first*** folder and call it ***second***
    `cd ..
    cp -r first second`

8. delete the ***second*** folder
    `rm -rf second`

### ****Part II****

1. What does the ***man*** command do? Type in ***man rm***. How do you scroll and get out?
    The `man` command is short for manuel and provides documentation for terminal command.
    Scrolling can be accomplished using the up and down arrows keys for vertical scrolling (left and right arrows allow for horizonal scrolling).
    Getting out of the manuel is accomplished with the 'Q' key.

2. Look at the ***man*** page for ***ls***. What does the ***-l*** flag do? What does the ***-a*** flag do?
    The `-l` flag lists files in long format with the file mode, number of links, owner name, group name, number of bytes in the file, abbreviated month,
    day-of-month file was last modified, hour file last modified, minute file last modified, and the pathname displayed as the output.
    The `-a` flag will include entries that begin with a dot '.' ie. hidden directories or files.

3. How do you jump between words in the terminal?
    Press the "option" + "left" or "right" arrow keys.

4. How do you get to the end of a line in terminal?
    Press "control" + "e".

5. How do you move your cursor to the beginning in terminal?
    Press "control" + "a".

6. How do you delete a word (without pressing backspace multiple times) in terminal?
    Press "control" + "w" to delete the word immediately left of the cursor.

7. What is the difference between a terminal and shell?
    The terminal is the interface that accepts commands and displays outputs.
    The shell is the software that interprets and runs the commands and returns an output.

8. What is an absolute path?
    The absolute path specifies the entire pathway to a file or directory from the root.

9. What is an relative path?
    The relative path specifies the pathway to a file or directory in relation to the working directory.

10. What is a flag? Give three examples of flags you have used.
    A flag is a command modifier and provides additonal options of execution to the usual command, examples in this lesson include the `-l`, `-a`, and `-rf` flags.

11. What do the ***r*** and ***f*** flags do with the ***rm*** command?
    In the `rm` command, the `-r` and `-f` flags attempt to remove the file hierarchy rooted in each file argument and remove the files without prompting for confirmation, respectively.
